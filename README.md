# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Implemented a deep learning model with Tensorflow library using Keras to predict whether a customer's loan request will be approved or not based on previous loan data.

** The Project is divided into following components :
  1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand the data and relation between different attributes.
  2. **Handling null values** in the dataset.
  3. **Conversion of Categorical attributes Numeric Dummy variables** so that it can be fed to the ML model.
  4. **Dropping repititive attributes** from the table.
  5. Creation of binary classification neural network with Tensorflow and training it on training set while implementing early stopping to avoid overfitting to training data and obtain least loss vector.
  6. Predicting the outcome for a new customer with given details whether the loan can be approved/granted or not.
