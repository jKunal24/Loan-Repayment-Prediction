# Loan-Approval-Prediction
Implemented a deep learning model with Tensorflow library using Keras to predict whether a borrower who has applied for a loan will be able to payback the loan amount in a specified period of time and thus helps the bank in making decision whether the bank can grant the loan or reject the loan application. .

** The Project is divided into following components :
  1. **Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand the data and relation between different attributes.
  2. **Handling null values** in the dataset.
  3. **Conversion of Categorical attributes Numeric Dummy variables** so that it can be fed to the ML model.
  4. **Dropping repititive attributes** from the table.
  5. Creation of **binary classification neural network with Tensorflow** and training it on training set while implementing early stopping to avoid overfitting to training data and obtain least loss vector.
  6. Predicting the outcome for a new customer with given details whether the loan can be approved/granted or not.
